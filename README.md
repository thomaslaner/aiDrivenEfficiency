# AI-Driven Efficiency: Large Languages Models in Business Process Optimization

Repository for my Masterâ€™s Thesis, completed at the Technical University of Vienna. This research explores the capabilities of current SOTA LLMs to streamline enterprise processes, using a best-practice evaluation within an Action Research framework.

## Abstract

The efficiency and adaptability of an organization are significantly influenced by its
business processes, which directly determine its ability to align with evolving market
demands and technological advancements. Business Process Management (BPM) has
traditionally relied on human expertise, particularly in the context of Business Process
Optimization (BPO), which involves the analysis and redesign of processes with the
objective of eliminating inefficiencies. As processes become increasingly complex and
the shortage of skilled workers persists, organizations are confronted with a widening
resource gap that current tools are unable to resolve, as they are incapable of automating
optimization.
A promising solution to this issue is offered by novel machine learning models, the so-called
Large Language Models (LLMs), which are capable of mimicking human decision-making
processes by generating contextually relevant insights. Nevertheless, their capacity to
automate BPO remains largely under-explored, representing a notable research gap. This
work is therefore guided by the question: Can Large Language Models be leveraged to
automate BPO, thereby overcoming the limitations of current automation methods?
The study answers this question in five iterative cycles by leveraging an action research
framework. Thereby, the initial two cycles are focused on evaluating the syntactic
capabilities of LLMs in adhering to process modeling criteria. The subsequent cycles are
then focused on evaluating their semantic ability to identify inefficiencies and implement
process optimizations.
Our results indicate that, while current state-of-the-art LLMs are capable of automating
certain aspects of BPO, they still require human supervision for complex workflows
involving task interdependencies and intricate process flows. The strong influence of
context and explicit guidance on model performance, along with the associated challenges
of overfitting, demand careful management. This suggests that full automation will
depend on further model advancements, deeper integration into organizational systems,
or a more carefully crafted approach and prompt design.
