# AI-Driven Efficiency: Large Languages Models in Business Process Optimization

Repository for my Masterâ€™s Thesis, completed at the Technical University of Vienna. This research investigates the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) in optimizing and streamlining enterprise processes. A structured best-practice evaluation framework, incorporating compliance testing with error injection, is applied within an Action Research methodology to rigorously assess LLM performance and limitations.

## Abstract

The efficiency and adaptability of an organization are significantly influenced by its
business processes, which directly determine its ability to align with evolving market
demands and technological advancements. Business Process Management (BPM) has
traditionally relied on human expertise, particularly in the context of Business Process
Optimization (BPO), which involves the analysis and redesign of processes with the
objective of eliminating inefficiencies. As processes become increasingly complex and
the shortage of skilled workers persists, organizations are confronted with a widening
resource gap that current tools are unable to resolve, as they are incapable of automating
optimization.

A promising solution to this issue is offered by novel machine learning models, the so-called
Large Language Models (LLMs), which are capable of mimicking human decision-making
processes by generating contextually relevant insights. Nevertheless, their capacity to
automate BPO remains largely under-explored, representing a notable research gap. This
work is therefore guided by the question: *To what extent do current state-of-the-art
Large Language Models align with established standards when performing business process
optimization tasks?*

The study answers this question by placing enforced focus on the impact of context, task
complexities, and the quality of the initial process through five iterative cycles within an
action research framework. Thereby, the initial two cycles are focused on evaluating the
syntactic capabilities of LLMs in adhering to process modeling criteria. The subsequent
cycles are then focused on evaluating their semantic ability to identify inefficiencies and
implement process optimizations.

Our results indicate that, while current state-of-the-art LLMs are capable of automating
certain aspects of BPO, they still require human supervision for complex workflows
involving task interdependencies and intricate process flows. The strong influence of
context on model performance, along with the associated challenges of overfitting, demand
careful management. However, we also observed that a negative plateau occurs in relation
to initial process quality, as beyond a certain threshold of degradation, further reductions
in quality do not proportionally worsen model performance, enabling real-world usage
even with suboptimal original processes. This suggests that full automation will depend
on further model advancements, deeper integration into organizational systems, or a
more carefully crafted approach and prompt design.
