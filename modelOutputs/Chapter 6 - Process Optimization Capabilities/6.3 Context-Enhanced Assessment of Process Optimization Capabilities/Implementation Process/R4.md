Taking into account your organization's approach of **Just-in-Time Documentation** and not following **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, here are the tailored optimizations:

1. **Just-in-Time Documentation Compliance**:
   - **Documentation at Final Implementation**: Since documentation reflects the final product, it should only begin after the core functionality is fully implemented and confirmed to work. In this case, rather than concurrent documentation updates during development, the documentation will occur after the successful tests, once the implementation is stable and final. This ensures that the documentation will match the final product without needing multiple revisions.

2. **Risk-Adjusted Testing without TDD**:
   - **Functional and Unit Testing (Manual & Automated)**: Since your organization avoids TDD, it's important to still catch bugs early without overly relying on pre-built tests. While automated testing remains valuable, I suggest focusing heavily on **manual exploratory testing** after each functional block is completed. This ensures that key requirements are fully understood before test cases are created. 
   
3. **Parallelization in Non-Testing Phases**:
   - **Code Review After Initial Testing**: Instead of starting code reviews during the implementation phase (which is more in line with TDD), it should occur after passing initial functional and unit tests. This ensures that the code review team works only with near-final code, reducing rework during the review process.

4. **Flexibility in Stakeholder Feedback**:
   - Since early stakeholder feedback may lead to changes, itâ€™s important to review requirements carefully before testing. You could still involve stakeholders in **early checkpoints** after partial functionality is stable, but the feedback would primarily focus on alignment rather than final approval, maintaining flexibility.

### Optimized Process Flow (Adjustments):

- **Post-Implementation Documentation**: 
   - Implement functionality -> Functional/unit tests -> Code review (secure coding) -> Final documentation.
   
- **Manual and Exploratory Testing Focus**:
   - Implement functionality -> Create test checklist -> Perform manual tests (functional & unit) to assess if key requirements are met -> Successful tests? If **No**, refine functionality, otherwise proceed.

- **Test Plan Creation**:
   - The test plan for stakeholders and external users can begin after successful internal tests but before the final review, ensuring alignment with the final documentation.

### Benefits:

- **Avoid Rework in Documentation**: Documentation only happens after the functionality is stable and final, eliminating any need for multiple iterations.
- **Higher Quality Code Reviews**: Code reviews happen on fully tested, stable code, reducing back-and-forth changes during review.
- **Manual Testing Emphasis**: This approach ensures that edge cases and critical requirements are not overlooked by automated scripts.
- **Efficient Stakeholder Involvement**: Feedback loops are timely, ensuring the project stays aligned with requirements without unnecessary delays.

This approach fits your documentation strategy and avoids premature test creation without compromising on efficiency or quality.
