Given the information about your organization's emphasis on "Just-in-Time Documentation" and the decision not to follow "Test-Driven Development," hereâ€™s an updated optimization that aligns with your approach:

### Revised Key Changes:

1. **Just-in-Time Documentation (JITD)**:
   - **Change**: Documentation tasks will only begin after the functionality is fully implemented and stabilized. Documentation work would happen after the successful test phase to reflect the final implementation.
   - **Reason**: This avoids the risk of reworking documentation based on unfinished or changing functionality, aligning with your JITD approach.

2. **Post-Development Testing**:
   - **Change**: Since you're not using Test-Driven Development (TDD), the creation of test checklists and the execution of tests will happen only after the implementation is complete, without early test case creation.
   - **Reason**: This ensures that test cases are aligned with finalized code, reducing the chance of missing key requirements due to premature test definition.

3. **Maintaining Manual Functional and Unit Tests**:
   - **Change**: Continue to perform functional and unit tests manually, but integrate tools for semi-automation to expedite repetitive tasks (e.g., data validation, user interface checks).
   - **Reason**: Since TDD is not practiced, having rigorous manual testing ensures key requirements are not missed, but semi-automation helps boost efficiency without compromising accuracy.

4. **Deferring Stakeholder Feedback**:
   - **Change**: Instead of involving stakeholders too early, keep the process focused on implementation and internal testing before preparing the final test plan and review documentation.
   - **Reason**: This reduces unnecessary back-and-forth with stakeholders during the iterative development stages, reflecting your efficiency-driven approach.

### Updated Optimized Process:

1. **Start**  
2. **Create Versioned Source Code Project**
   - No change.
3. **Implement Functionality**
   - Focus on getting the core implementation done first before involving documentation or stakeholder feedback.
4. **Create Test Checklist**
   - Create the test checklist after functionality is implemented.
5. **Manually Perform Functional and Unit Tests**
   - Perform rigorous manual testing, with possible semi-automation for repetitive tasks.
6. **Tests Successful?**  
   - **Yes**: Proceed to code review.
   - **No**: Go back to refine the implementation.
7. **Code Review (Secure Coding)**  
   - Continue with manual reviews with secure coding in mind.
8. **Document Functionality (JITD)**  
   - Start documenting only after successful code review and tests, ensuring that documentation reflects the final, stable implementation.
9. **Create Test Plan for Stakeholders**  
   - Finalize the test plan based on the reviewed and tested code.
10. **All Requirements Fulfilled?**  
    - If yes, proceed to finalize the project.
11. **End**

This version of the process keeps your workflow efficient, minimizes unnecessary rework, and ensures that the final documentation and tests align with the completed, stable codebase.
