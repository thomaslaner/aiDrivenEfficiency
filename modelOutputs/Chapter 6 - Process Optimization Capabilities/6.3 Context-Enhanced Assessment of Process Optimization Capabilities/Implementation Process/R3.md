Considering your organization's use of "Just-in-Time Documentation" and avoidance of "Test-Driven Development" (TDD), hereâ€™s an optimized process tailored to these principles:

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Just-in-Time Documentation:**
   - **Change:** Move the "Document Functionality" step to the end of the process after all functionality has been finalized and tested.
   - **Rationale:** This avoids any rework of documentation by ensuring that it is created only after the implementation is fully complete. This aligns perfectly with your organization's approach to documentation, reflecting the final state of the system without unnecessary intermediate drafts.

2. **Shift Focus from Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - **Change:** The process should focus on implementing functionality first without creating test cases prematurely. Ensure tests are created only after clear understanding of the requirements and implementation.
   - **Rationale:** This reduces the risk of premature tests missing important requirements or becoming outdated as the project evolves.

### Updated Process:
- **1. Start**
- **2. Create Versioned Source Code Project**
- **3. Implement Functionality (Based on clear and finalized requirements)**
- **4. Create Test Checklist & Perform Functional/Unit Tests (Automated tests where applicable)** 
- **5. Test Successful?**
   - **No:** Return to "Implement Functionality"
   - **Yes:** Continue
- **6. Code Review (Secure Coding)**
- **7. CI Integration (if applicable)**
- **8. Create Test Plan for Stakeholders**
- **9. Stakeholder Testing: All requirements fulfilled?**
   - **No:** Feedback loop to "Implement Functionality"
   - **Yes:** Proceed to next step
- **10. Document Final Functionality (Just-in-Time Documentation reflecting the final state)**
- **End**

### Rationale for Key Adjustments:
- **Just-in-Time Documentation:** Moving the documentation phase to the end ensures that the documentation effort is efficient, avoids rework, and perfectly matches the final implementation.
- **Focus on Post-Implementation Testing:** Since TDD is not followed, the testing steps (checklist and actual tests) are created after the implementation, ensuring that the testing is relevant and robust without the risks of missing critical functionality.

This approach ensures that documentation aligns with your organization's priorities, while the absence of TDD is balanced by strong post-implementation testing.
