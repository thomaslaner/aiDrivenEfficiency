Given this additional information, I would suggest a refined optimization of the process to focus on the following priorities:

### 1. **Minimize Translation Team Workload**
   - **Current Issue:** The translation team is involved in creating translations for mockups, even though the designs do not require perfect wording.
   - **Change:** Reduce the translation team's role during early mockup stages. Only involve them at the **final stage** when the wording is essential and stable. Early mockups can use placeholder text to avoid unnecessary translation efforts. Only when mockups are ready for review or freeze should the translation team step in.

### 2. **Focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and UI Designers’ Role**
   - **Current Issue:** The process heavily involves project managers in mockup reviews, which could slow down HCI-focused design work.
   - **Change:** Let UI Designers take full ownership of the mockup review related to HCI, without the need for immediate project manager involvement. This empowers UI Designers to quickly iterate based on their expertise in interaction design, streamlining the early stages.

### 3. **Real-Time Risk Analysis**
   - **Current Issue:** Risk analysis is currently treated as a separate, later stage, which causes delays and does not align with management’s expectations.
   - **Change:** Implement **ongoing risk analysis** that evolves in real-time alongside mockup development. The ICT project team should continuously update the risk analysis after every significant design check (e.g., after HCI review and user experience check), not only at the final stages.

### 4. **Automation and Tooling for Risk and QA Reporting**
   - **Current Issue:** Manual quality control and risk reporting add to the workload and cause delays.
   - **Change:** Introduce automated tools to provide real-time feedback on design issues related to HCI and user experience. Tools like automated usability testing or risk management software can support faster, more accurate assessments. This reduces manual QA efforts and accelerates the feedback loop.

### 5. **Simplified Decision-Making Process**
   - **Current Issue:** The process requires multiple rounds of approval, creating bottlenecks, especially when adjustments are necessary.
   - **Change:** Delegate decision-making for HCI and UX directly to the UI Designers and Frontend Quality Assurance team. Involve the project manager only when critical changes affect broader project goals or introduce significant risks.

### Updated Optimized Process Flow:

1. **Create technical solution concept** → no change.
2. **Develop mockup** → Use placeholder wording in early mockups, allowing designers to focus on HCI without translation.
3. **Mockup Review: Human-Computer Interaction** → UI Designers take full responsibility for this stage, making quick iterative improvements.
4. **Design Check: User Experience** → Continue involving QA and UI Designers; project manager only steps in for major design risks.
5. **Ongoing Risk Analysis** → The ICT project team should perform a continuous risk analysis after each review, updating management proactively.
6. **Define Final Wording and Translations (if necessary)** → Involve the translation team only at this stage to minimize their workload.
7. **Implement feedback and adapt translations if needed** → Quick iterations with final wording.
8. **Freeze mockup** → Conduct final risk analysis updates before freezing.
9. **Design Review: Concept and technical feasibility** → Use automated QA tools for the final review.

### Rationale for the Changes:
- **Translation Team’s Involvement:** Involving the translation team only at the end when necessary, allows for a faster design process while reducing their workload.
- **HCI Prioritization:** By giving UI Designers autonomy over HCI-related decisions, you eliminate unnecessary feedback loops, allowing for faster progression.
- **Continuous Risk Analysis:** Integrating real-time risk analysis ensures management’s expectations are met without waiting for the final stages, and decisions can be made with evolving risks in mind.
- **Automation:** Automation for quality assurance and risk feedback ensures the process runs smoothly without extensive manual intervention.

This optimized process is better aligned with the project goals while considering resource constraints.
