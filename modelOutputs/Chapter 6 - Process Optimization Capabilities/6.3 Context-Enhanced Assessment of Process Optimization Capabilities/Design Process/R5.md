Based on the given requirements, here’s a further optimized version of the process flow to address the priorities for Human-Computer Interaction, minimize the translation team’s workload, and incorporate ongoing risk analysis.

### Optimized Process Workflow:

1. **Start**.
   
2. **Create technical solution concept**.
   - *Responsible*: Project Manager, ICT Project Team.
   - *Documents*: Requirements Specification, Development Guidelines, Design Document.
   
3. **Develop initial mockup (focus on HCI)**.
   - *Responsible*: Project Manager, UI Designer.
   - *Participating*: ICT Project Team.
   - *Documents*: Design Document, Mockup.
   - *Notes*: Since wording isn't a priority, focus on functional and interaction elements rather than perfect wording.

4. **Mockup Review: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**.
   - *Responsible*: Project Manager.
   - *Participating*: UI Designer, QA Coordinator.
   - *Documents*: Mockup, QA Report.
   - *Notes*: Assess HCI features without involving translation team unless absolutely necessary for interaction-related text. This minimizes their involvement in non-crucial phases.

5. **Design Check: User Experience (optional, if needed)**.
   - *Responsible*: Project Manager.
   - *Participating*: UI Designer, QA Coordinator.
   - *Documents*: Mockup, QA Report.
   - *Notes*: If needed, the wording is reviewed for UX purposes, but only if it impacts usability significantly.

6. **Ongoing Risk Analysis (Parallel Step)**.
   - *Responsible*: Project Manager.
   - *Participating*: Subject Experts, ICT Project Team.
   - *Documents*: Risk Analysis, QA Report.
   - *Notes*: Risk analysis is continuously updated throughout the process as the mockup evolves, rather than waiting until the final review phase.

7. **Integrate Feedback into Mockup**.
   - *Responsible*: ICT Project Team.
   - *Participating*: Project Manager.
   - *Documents*: QA Report, Mockup.
   - *Notes*: Minor wording issues can be left for later unless critical to the design or user interaction.

8. **Wording Adjustments (Only when necessary)**.
   - *Responsible*: UI Designer.
   - *Participating*: Translation Team (if needed).
   - *Documents*: Mockup, List of Translations, Glossary.
   - *Notes*: If wording impacts interaction or UX critically, translation team involvement is minimal and selective to avoid overburdening.

9. **Freeze Mockup**.
   - *Responsible*: ICT Project Team.
   - *Documents*: Mockup, Risk Analysis.
   - *Notes*: Freeze mockup after critical feedback is integrated, focusing on HCI and minimizing non-essential wording updates.

10. **Finalize Risk Analysis and Design Review**.
    - *Responsible*: Project Manager, Review Team.
    - *Documents*: IT Service Tree, Risk Analysis, Design Document.
    - *Notes*: Finalize risk analysis in parallel with the mockup freezing phase to meet management’s expectations for real-time updates.

11. **End**.

### Key Adjustments Based on the New Criteria:
- **Translation Team Workload Minimized**: Involvement of the translation team is reduced to critical moments where wording impacts interaction or UX significantly. This ensures that their workload remains manageable.
  
- **Risk Analysis is Continuous**: Risk analysis runs parallel to the design and mockup stages, evolving together with the project to meet management’s requirements for real-time updates.

- **Focus on Interaction Over Wording**: Mockups prioritize Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and wording is only refined where necessary, reducing unnecessary adjustments and translation iterations.

This streamlined approach ensures alignment with management’s expectations for evolving risk analysis while maintaining focus on interaction, minimizing wording tasks, and reducing the translation team’s workload.
