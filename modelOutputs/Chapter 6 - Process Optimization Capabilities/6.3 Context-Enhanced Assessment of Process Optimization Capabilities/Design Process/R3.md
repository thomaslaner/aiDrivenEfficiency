Given the additional considerations, here is a refined optimization that addresses both the focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the need for evolving risk analysis, while also minimizing the workload of the translation team:

### Adjustments to the Process:

1. **Focus on HCI Without Early Wording Finalization**:
   - Since the mockups prioritize HCI, perfect wording is not required upfront. The translation team should only be involved when the mockup design is near finalization to avoid unnecessary changes that require translation updates. This reduces the translation team's workload.
   
2. **Evolving Risk Analysis Throughout the Process**:
   - To align with management's requirement for a real-time evolving risk analysis, the risk assessment should be integrated into key decision points and updated incrementally as the design progresses. This ensures that risks are tracked continuously, without waiting for the final stages.

3. **Translation Team Engages Later**:
   - The translation team's involvement should be deferred until after the first round of feedback from the Design Review. This prevents them from translating elements that are likely to change, minimizing rework. Any minor wording required during HCI design reviews can be handled by the project team, as perfect wording is not necessary at that stage.

### Optimized Process Flow (with adjustments):

1. **Start**  
2. **Create technical solution concept**  
    - (Documents: Requirements Specification, Development Guidelines, Design Document)  
    - *Begin Initial Risk Analysis*
3. **Develop mockup**  
    - (Incorporate continuous QA feedback with a focus on HCI)  
    - (Documents: Design Document, Mockup)  
    - *Ongoing Risk Analysis Updates*  
4. **Design Review: UX and HCI**  
    - *UI Designers and HCI Experts finalize interaction elements*  
    - *Light feedback on wording as necessary by project team*  
    - *Risk analysis is updated based on review results*  
    - (Documents: QA Report, Mockup, Design Document, Risk Analysis)  
5. **Mockup adjustments necessary?**  
    - *Yes*: Implement feedback  
    - *No*: Proceed to finalization  
6. **Implement Feedback and Finalize Mockup**  
    - Only when the mockup is stable:  
    - **Define wording and create translations of mockup elements**  
    - (Documents: Mockup, List of Translations, Glossary)  
7. **Integrate finalized wording into mockup**  
    - (Documents: Glossary, Mockup)  
    - *Final Risk Analysis update*  
8. **Freeze Mockup**  
    - (Documents: Mockup, Risk Analysis)  
9. **Design Review: Concept and technical feasibility**  
    - *Final step*: Documents updated automatically  
    - (Documents: IT Service Tree, Risk Analysis, Design Document)

### Key Benefits of These Adjustments:

1. **Reduced Workload on Translation Team**:
   - The translation team is only involved after the design is nearly finalized, preventing the need for frequent updates due to ongoing design changes. Minor wording for early-stage reviews can be managed by the project team, especially since perfect wording is not crucial at the HCI stage.

2. **Continuous Risk Management**:
   - Risk analysis evolves alongside the design and is updated at each key review point, ensuring that managementâ€™s expectations are met without waiting until the end of the process. This minimizes the risk of overlooking issues that could arise later.

3. **Streamlined Reviews with Focus on Interaction**:
   - The review process is centered around the core priority: Human-Computer Interaction. Design and usability elements are finalized before bringing in other aspects such as translation, making the process more efficient.

By integrating risk updates throughout and strategically involving the translation team later in the process, this optimization maximizes efficiency while keeping the focus on HCI and minimizing unnecessary workload.
