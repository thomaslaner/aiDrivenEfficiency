Considering your organizational focus on reducing internal controls, parallelizing tasks, and gathering feedback post-Go-Live, here's an optimized process based on your guidelines:

### 1. **Combine Internal Approval and Final Test**
   - **Change**: Merge “Internal Approval of successful deployment” and “Final Test” into one streamlined task.
   - **Reason**: Since internal approval relies on successful test results, it makes sense to combine these steps into one. This will minimize unnecessary control steps and shorten the process timeline.

### 2. **Eliminate Manual User Satisfaction Analysis**
   - **Change**: Remove the “Manual User Satisfaction Analysis” step entirely.
   - **Reason**: Since feedback is only gathered post-Go-Live through tickets, this step becomes redundant. Real-time ticket creation from the live system can act as the primary means of gathering user feedback, reducing the need for a separate analysis.

### 3. **Merge PR Campaign with Go Live**
   - **Change**: Combine the “PR Campaign” and “Go Live” steps into one.
   - **Reason**: By preparing the PR communication in parallel with the final stages of deployment and testing, the Go Live and campaign launch can occur simultaneously. This prevents delays and makes the process more efficient by removing the need for separate campaigns after Go Live.

### 4. **Parallelized Project Presentation and PR Campaign**
   - **Change**: If the “Project Presentation to Management” is needed, run it in parallel with the PR Campaign preparation.
   - **Reason**: Running the management presentation and PR tasks in parallel ensures that both management and public stakeholders are updated without delaying the Go Live phase.

### 5. **Feedback After Go Live**
   - **Change**: Focus on gathering user feedback solely through post-Go-Live tickets from the live system.
   - **Reason**: Since user satisfaction will be monitored through live system tickets, remove any pre-Go-Live manual feedback collection steps. This will align with your organization’s emphasis on collecting feedback only after the system goes live.

### Optimized Flow Summary:
- Deployment on Production Systems
- **Combined Final Test & Internal Approval** (Parallel task)
- Project Presentation to Management (if needed) (Parallel to PR)
- **PR Campaign and Go Live** (Combined task)
- Feedback via tickets post-Go Live (replacing Manual User Satisfaction Analysis)
- Project Review & Effectiveness Evaluation

This process focuses on simplifying tasks by combining and parallelizing steps where possible. It also eliminates unnecessary controls and focuses on post-Go-Live feedback, as aligned with your organizational values.
