Based on your organization's priorities and feedback mechanisms, here are additional tailored optimizations for your process:

1. **Eliminate "Manual User Satisfaction Analysis" Before Go-Live**:
   - Since feedback is gathered only post-Go-Live and tickets are created after the system is live, the "Manual User Satisfaction Analysis" step before Go-Live becomes redundant. Instead, integrate this into the post-Go-Live phase, which is already covered through live-system feedback and ticket creation.

2. **Merge "Go Live" and "User Satisfaction Analysis" Steps**:
   - Combine the "Go Live" phase with the process for collecting feedback. Since your organization gathers feedback post-Go-Live, streamline the transition from deployment to user feedback analysis within the live environment itself, reducing the need for a separate analysis step.

3. **Parallelize "Project Presentation to Management" with PR Campaign**:
   - If the same team members are involved in both management presentations and PR campaigns, these tasks can be run concurrently. This reduces delays due to sequential dependencies, speeding up the process flow.

4. **Eliminate or Automate Non-Essential Team-Internal Controls**:
   - If there are any steps or approval phases that are purely internal and don't add clear value to stakeholders (such as additional internal reviews), they should either be eliminated or automated to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks.

5. **Simplify Final Test and Approval**:
   - Combine the "Final Test" and "Internal Approval of Deployment" into one validation phase. This ensures the system is tested and approved in a single streamlined step, cutting down on back-and-forth between teams.

6. **Post-Go-Live Ticket Creation**:
   - Since tickets are generated post-Go-Live based on feedback, ensure that your "Go Live" process includes an automatic trigger for ticket collection and categorization. This can include deploying mechanisms to gather user feedback directly into the ticketing system, which can save time and reduce manual follow-ups.

By aligning the process with the organizationâ€™s focus on efficiency and stakeholder value, these optimizations further simplify execution, avoid redundant checks, and help ensure parallel progress where feasible.
