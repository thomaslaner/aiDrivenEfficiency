Based on your organization's approach and focus on reducing unnecessary controls and parallelizing tasks, here are further optimizations to streamline the process:

### Optimized Process (Considering Efficiency Focus)

1. **Deployment and Internal Approval Combined**:
   - Since internal approval often involves the same team that manages deployment, merge both tasks into a single step. Internal controls that don’t add value to stakeholders can be minimized, focusing on task completion in a single flow.
   
   **Change**: Deployment and approval are now handled in one efficient step with minimal internal checks.

2. **Final Test**:
   - The final test can be partially automated and run in parallel with other steps. For example, while the system is undergoing final tests, the PR campaign can begin preparing announcements or key updates, reducing the time gap between testing and going live.
   
   **Change**: The "Final Test" is parallelized with "PR Campaign Preparation" to speed up execution.

3. **Remove Project Presentation to Management**:
   - Since your organization reduces team-internal controls and focuses on stakeholder value, this step can be eliminated unless absolutely necessary. Management presentations could be scheduled earlier or combined with other key decision points like the pre-Go-Live checklist.
   
   **Change**: Remove the "Project Presentation to Management" step as it might not add immediate stakeholder value unless there is a major concern.

4. **PR Campaign in Parallel**:
   - The PR campaign can fully prepare and initiate during the testing phase. This ensures that the team is ready for communication once the system goes live, removing delays caused by waiting for post-test results.
   
   **Change**: Run the "PR Campaign" entirely in parallel with the "Final Test."

5. **Automated Feedback Collection Post-Go-Live**:
   - As tickets are created post-Go-Live based on real-time feedback, the step “Manual User Satisfaction Analysis” should be replaced with an automated user feedback system. This feedback will generate tickets automatically, providing an efficient way to manage issues without manual intervention.

   **Change**: Implement "Automated Feedback Collection" post-Go-Live.

6. **Streamlined Project Review & Lessons Learned**:
   - Combine project review and lessons learned into one streamlined session post-Go-Live, focusing on ticket data, feedback analysis, and key insights to adapt future processes. This removes redundant review steps.
   
   **Change**: Combine "Project Review" with "Effectiveness Evaluation" and "Lessons Learned."

### Optimized Process Flow:

1. **Deployment and Internal Approval** (Combined step)
2. **Final Test** (Run in parallel with PR Campaign)
3. **PR Campaign** (Parallel with Final Test)
4. **Go Live**
5. **Automated User Feedback Collection** (Post-Go-Live tickets generated)
6. **Combined Project Review, Effectiveness Evaluation, and Lessons Learned**

This further refinement aligns with your organizational goal to prioritize stakeholder value and reduce unnecessary internal controls, focusing on parallelizing tasks and minimizing dependencies.
