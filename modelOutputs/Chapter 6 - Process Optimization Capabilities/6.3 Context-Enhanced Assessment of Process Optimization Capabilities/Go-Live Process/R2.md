Given your organizationâ€™s focus on efficiency and reducing unnecessary internal controls, along with the post-Go-Live feedback system, I would make the following adjustments:

### Optimized Workflow Adjustments:
1. **Parallelization of Tasks**:
   - **Change**: Combine the "Project Presentation to Management" and "PR Campaign" into one parallel process.
   - **Reason**: Since both involve communication, aligning them allows the PR Team to begin campaign preparation even before the formal presentation occurs. This minimizes delays between decision-making and external communication.

2. **Streamlining Feedback Collection**:
   - **Change**: Remove the "Manual User Satisfaction Analysis" before Go-Live. Instead, focus entirely on collecting tickets from the live system after Go-Live.
   - **Reason**: Based on your approach, formal user feedback isn't necessary pre-Go-Live, so collecting satisfaction data can be more effectively handled post-Go-Live using the actual system in operation, saving time and reducing redundant pre-Go-Live analysis.

3. **Combining Documentation Efforts**:
   - **Change**: Integrate the "Final Test" and "Internal Approval" into the Go-Live process, allowing both tasks to happen simultaneously within the same documentation and evaluation phase.
   - **Reason**: This reduces the steps without impacting the final outcome, allowing teams to prepare for Go-Live while testing is completed in parallel.

### Optimized Workflow Overview (Considering New Focus):
1. **Start**  
   a. Deployment on Production Systems (using combined Go-Live Documentation)  
   b. **Final Test and Approval** (done in parallel with PR prep)
2. **Project Presentation to Management (if needed)** and **PR Campaign** (parallelized)  
3. **Go Live**  
4. **Post-Go-Live Ticket Collection & System Effectiveness Evaluation** (tickets from live system feed directly into review)

By consolidating controls and parallelizing steps, you reduce unnecessary waiting times and leverage your post-Go-Live feedback loop more effectively.
