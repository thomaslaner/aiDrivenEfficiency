Given your organization's prioritization of efficiency, minimizing internal controls, and post-Go-Live feedback collection, I would refine the previous optimizations with a stronger emphasis on parallelizing tasks and removing steps that do not directly add stakeholder value.

### Updated Process Optimizations:

### 1. **Parallelize "Final Test" and "Internal Approval"**
   - **Change:** Run the "Final Test" and "Internal Approval of successful deployment" steps in parallel, since both aim to confirm the deployment's success.
   - **Reason:** Parallel execution speeds up the process by reducing delays between validation and approval. This also fits your focus on reducing internal controls that don't add stakeholder value.

### 2. **Combine User Satisfaction Analysis with Go-Live**
   - **Change:** Remove "Manual User Satisfaction Analysis" as a separate step. Instead, gather user feedback during the "Go Live" phase through automated systems, and log it post-Go-Live for analysis.
   - **Reason:** As tickets are created post-Go-Live, feedback will naturally be collected during the live system phase. There's no need for a separate manual analysis step.

### 3. **Eliminate Project Presentation Unless Required**
   - **Change:** Remove the "Project Presentation to Management" step unless it is absolutely necessary based on the strategic importance of the project.
   - **Reason:** Only projects that significantly impact stakeholders or management decisions should require a formal presentation, saving time and resources for both the project manager and management.

### 4. **Run PR Campaign in Parallel with Go-Live Readiness**
   - **Change:** Launch the "PR Campaign" preparation (if needed) in parallel with the "Go Live Readiness Review."
   - **Reason:** This reduces delays between PR preparation and system launch, aligning communication with technical execution.

### 5. **Integrated Go-Live and Ticket Management**
   - **Change:** Ensure that the "Go Live" step includes an automated system for logging user feedback and tickets, making feedback gathering and resolution part of the Go-Live phase itself.
   - **Reason:** This removes the need for a separate feedback phase and speeds up the response to any issues that arise after the system is live.

### Final Optimized Process Flow:
- **Deployment on Production Systems**
- **Parallel: Final Test & Internal Approval**
- **Optional: Project Presentation to Management (only if strategically important)**
- **Parallel: PR Campaign & Go Live Readiness Review**
- **Go Live (includes feedback collection and ticket management)**
- **Project Review & Effectiveness Evaluation**

These changes reduce the overall process timeline by merging and parallelizing tasks where feasible, while maintaining the integrity of the go-live feedback and ticketing system, aligned with your organization's efficiency goals. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
