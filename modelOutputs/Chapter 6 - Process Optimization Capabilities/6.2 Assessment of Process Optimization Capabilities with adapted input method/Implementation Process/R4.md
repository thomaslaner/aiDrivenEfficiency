To optimize this process, I will suggest some improvements based on common best practices and areas where efficiency can be enhanced:

1. **Parallelization of Tasks**:
   - **Code Review and Test Checklist**: Code review can start after implementing functionality, rather than waiting until after tests have passed. This will reduce idle time for the review team, as they can review parts of the functionality already implemented before testing is fully completed.
   
   - **Test Plan Creation**: Rather than waiting until after documentation is complete to start the test plan creation, this task can run in parallel once the implementation phase is finished, based on the test checklist.

2. **Automated Testing Integration**:
   - **Manual Unit and Functional Tests**: Introduce automated testing to reduce the time and effort spent on manual testing. Automated test suites can quickly run through large numbers of tests and ensure that code is regression-free.

3. **Continuous Testing**:
   - **Test after Each Functional Addition**: Instead of waiting for the full implementation before testing, introduce continuous testing. This means running tests after every significant functionality addition. This can lead to quicker identification and resolution of bugs.

4. **Documentation Updates During Development**:
   - **Concurrent Documentation**: Allow for partial documentation to be updated during the implementation phase rather than waiting until functionality is fully implemented. This allows the documentation team to keep pace with the development, which will speed up the overall process.

5. **Risk Analysis Integration**:
   - Risk analysis should be part of each step of the process, especially during the testing and code review stages. This ensures that security, performance, and scalability risks are addressed early, avoiding costly revisions later.

6. **Stakeholder Involvement at Early Stages**:
   - **Early Feedback**: Involve stakeholders earlier in the process, potentially right after a significant functional module is implemented, to ensure alignment and reduce any surprises in later stages. This feedback loop can be invaluable and prevent large-scale reworks.

### Revised Process Flow:

- **Implementation & Continuous Testing**: 
    - Implement functionality -> Partial code review -> Continuous testing of new functionality (automated or manual) -> Parallel update of the test plan and documentation.
   
- **Final Stages**: 
    - Once the final feature set is implemented and tested, a full code review, followed by final testing and documentation, can be completed.

- **Review & Feedback**: 
    - Include stakeholders in feedback sessions after each major module's implementation, thus aligning their requirements continuously.

### Benefits of these Changes:
- **Time Efficiency**: Reducing waiting times by running tasks in parallel and involving automated tools for testing.
- **Early Detection**: Problems and risks are identified and mitigated earlier in the process.
- **Reduced Manual Workload**: Automating tests cuts down the time spent on manual verification.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Continuous alignment ensures that stakeholder needs are met earlier, reducing rework at the end.
