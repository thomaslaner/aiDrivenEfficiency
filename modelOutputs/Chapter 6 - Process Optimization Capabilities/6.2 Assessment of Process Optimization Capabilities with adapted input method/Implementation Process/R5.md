To optimize this process, we can focus on improving efficiency, reducing redundancies, and enhancing communication between stakeholders. Here’s an optimized version and the rationale behind each change:

### 1. **Parallel Work for Functional Implementation and Testing**:
   **Change**: Allow parallel work between implementing functionality and creating the test checklist. This eliminates waiting time and improves efficiency. 
   
   **Reason**: While functionality is being developed, the test checklist can be prepared based on the specification sheet. This way, once the functionality is complete, tests can start immediately, saving time.

### 2. **Automated Testing Integration**:
   **Change**: Add automated testing between "Manually Perform functional and unit tests" and "Tests successful?" for routine checks.
   
   **Reason**: Automating certain repetitive and predictable tests (like unit tests) speeds up the testing process and increases accuracy by reducing human errors. Manual testing can still be performed but should focus on edge cases and functionality validation.

### 3. **Conditional Gate for Code Review**:
   **Change**: Add a condition before "Code Review (secure coding)" that checks if the implementation impacts security-critical features. Only proceed with a secure code review if needed.
   
   **Reason**: Not all code changes impact security. This step can sometimes be skipped or deferred, depending on the scope of the change, reducing unnecessary delays.

### 4. **Simultaneous Documentation**:
   **Change**: Allow documentation of functionality to begin as soon as functionality is implemented, instead of waiting until after testing is successful.
   
   **Reason**: Documentation is often delayed until testing is done, but non-technical documentation can begin earlier, reducing the overall timeline. Developers can provide technical input as the code progresses, refining documentation iteratively.

### 5. **Continuous Feedback Loop with Stakeholders**:
   **Change**: Add a stakeholder feedback loop after creating the test plan for stakeholders.
   
   **Reason**: Early involvement of stakeholders allows for faster feedback and ensures that requirements are met without unnecessary back-and-forth at the end of the process. This can reduce the need for extensive rework later on.

### 6. **Clarifying Requirements Verification**:
   **Change**: Explicitly specify that verification of "all requirements fulfilled" should be both functional and non-functional (e.g., performance, security, usability).
   
   **Reason**: Sometimes, only functional requirements are considered. Non-functional requirements are equally important, and their inclusion ensures a more robust final product.

### 7. **Risk-based Testing Approach**:
   **Change**: Implement a risk-based testing approach by adding a "Risk Analysis" phase before performing tests.
   
   **Reason**: Prioritizing testing based on risk can ensure that the most critical parts of the system are tested thoroughly, while less critical components receive less intensive testing, saving time and resources.

Here’s an outline of the updated process:

1. **Start**
2. **Creating a versioned source code project** → (Version management)
3. **Parallel**:
   - **Implement Functionality** → (Specification Sheet, Version management)
   - **Create Test Checklist** → (Specification Sheet, Version management, Internal Test Checklist)
4. **Automated Tests (if applicable)** → Proceed based on result
5. **Manually Perform functional and unit tests** → (Specification Sheet, Version management, Internal Test Checklist)
6. **Tests successful?** 
   - No → Implement fixes
   - Yes → **Proceed**
7. **Conditional Secure Code Review (if security-relevant)**
   - If necessary → (Version management, Code Review Report)
8. **Document Functionality** (can begin earlier, parallel to some testing) → (User Documentation)
9. **Create test plan for stakeholders** → (User Documentation, External Test Checklist)
10. **Stakeholder feedback loop** → Ensures alignment with expectations
11. **All requirements fulfilled?** (Functional and Non-functional)
   - Yes → **End**
