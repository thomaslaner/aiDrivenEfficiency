To optimize the process shown in the diagram, I'll suggest some improvements that can increase efficiency, reduce redundancy, and enhance clarity.

1. **Combine “Deployment on Production Systems” and “Internal Approval of successful deployment”**:
   - These two steps could be merged into a single step to reduce unnecessary approval stages. Instead, integrate internal approvals within the deployment process itself to streamline the flow.

   **Change**: 
   - Combined into "Deployment and Internal Approval."

2. **Final Test**:
   - The "Final Test" step should include a well-defined automated testing process that runs concurrently with deployment to avoid unnecessary delays. Consider parallel testing to cut down waiting times for manual checks.
   
   **Change**: 
   - Ensure automation tools are used to handle large parts of the testing process.

3. **Eliminate the “Project Presentation to Management” decision node**:
   - If a project presentation is needed for all go-live decisions, it could be pre-scheduled earlier in the project timeline rather than post-testing to avoid any delays in management approvals. Only projects requiring special management approval should go through this extra step.

   **Change**:
   - Remove decision point; include scheduled management check-in before final deployment.

4. **PR Campaign**:
   - In the PR step, clarify that the campaign should begin in parallel with the final test and management presentation. This avoids bottlenecks by ensuring PR preparations don’t have to wait for testing to finish.

   **Change**: 
   - Run the "PR Campaign" preparation alongside the "Final Test."

5. **Manual User Satisfaction Analysis**:
   - Automate user satisfaction gathering as much as possible by integrating feedback mechanisms into the system and collecting this data from live usage post-deployment.

   **Change**:
   - Replace "Manual User Satisfaction Analysis" with "Automated User Feedback Collection."

6. **Go Live Step**:
   - A clearer Go-Live checklist could be introduced to ensure all necessary checks are completed before the system is live.

   **Change**:
   - Introduce a standardized Go-Live checklist.

7. **Combine “Project Review & Effectiveness Evaluation” with Lessons Learned**:
   - These two can be effectively streamlined into one session or process to gather feedback and implement changes immediately, without splitting the review across different phases.
   
   **Change**:
   - Merge "Project Review" and "Lessons Learned."

### Optimized Process Summary:

1. **Deployment and Internal Approval** (Combined step)
2. **Final Test** (With parallel automated testing)
3. **Scheduled Management Check-In** (Pre-deployment)
4. **PR Campaign Preparation** (Runs in parallel with final test)
5. **Automated User Feedback Collection** (Replaces manual analysis)
6. **Go Live** (With standardized checklist)
7. **Combined Project Review & Lessons Learned**

This optimized process aims to reduce delays and manual steps while improving the flow with more automation and parallel activities.
