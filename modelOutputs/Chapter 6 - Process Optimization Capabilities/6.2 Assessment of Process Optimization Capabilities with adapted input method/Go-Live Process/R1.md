To optimize the process depicted in your diagram, I would suggest a few changes to streamline communication, reduce potential delays, and ensure better stakeholder engagement. Below is an outline of these optimizations and the reasoning behind them:

### 1. **Preliminary Testing Before Production Deployment**
   - **Change**: Add a preliminary testing phase (like User Acceptance Testing - UAT) before the “Deployment on Production Systems” step.
   - **Reason**: This helps identify issues earlier and ensures a smoother production deployment. The UAT can be performed by key stakeholders and users to verify the system's functionality before full deployment.

### 2. **Parallel Internal Approval and Final Test**
   - **Change**: Allow “Internal Approval of successful deployment” and the “Final Test” to run in parallel.
   - **Reason**: These two steps can occur simultaneously as the approval might be contingent on the final test results. This reduces bottlenecks, saving time.

### 3. **Automated User Satisfaction Analysis**
   - **Change**: Replace “Manual User Satisfaction Analysis” with an automated feedback collection process, using online surveys or feedback tools from the live system.
   - **Reason**: Automation will expedite data collection and provide more structured insights into user satisfaction, saving time and resources from manual analysis.

### 4. **Merge PR Campaign and Project Presentation**
   - **Change**: Combine “Project Presentation to Management” and the “PR Campaign” into a single step where management reviews include a briefing on PR initiatives.
   - **Reason**: If the presentation to management is necessary, the PR strategy can be incorporated to avoid separate presentations, streamlining the flow and reducing redundancy.

### 5. **Documentation Flow Improvements**
   - **Change**: Consolidate the number of documents referenced, especially between deployment and final testing, into a single unified "Deployment and Testing Report."
   - **Reason**: Instead of maintaining several documents like “IT Service Map” and “Internal Test Checklist,” combining these into a single report will simplify documentation handling and make the process more efficient for both reference and approval stages.

### 6. **Final Review before Go Live**
   - **Change**: Introduce a lightweight "Final Readiness Review" just before the “Go Live” step.
   - **Reason**: A quick final review ensures that any last-minute changes or issues can be addressed before going live, reducing the risk of post-launch problems.

### 7. **Faster Go Live Announcement**
   - **Change**: Simplify the “Announcement” process during the Go Live phase with automated or pre-planned communications (such as using automated emails or notifications).
   - **Reason**: Having a pre-prepared template or automated announcement system ensures a faster Go Live process without delays from manual communication steps.

### 8. **Early Involvement of PR Team**
   - **Change**: Engage the PR Team earlier in the process, possibly during the “Internal Approval” stage.
   - **Reason**: This allows for PR strategies to be developed in parallel with the internal approval and testing phases, ensuring the team is fully prepared for communication efforts when deployment is complete.

### Summary of Optimized Process Flow
- **Preliminary Test (UAT)**
- Deployment on Production Systems
- Internal Approval and Final Test (Parallel)
- PR and Management Presentation (Unified)
- Automated User Satisfaction Collection
- Final Readiness Review
- Go Live (with Automated Announcement)
- Project Review & Effectiveness Evaluation

These changes aim to make the process more efficient by reducing manual steps, creating parallel paths for approval and testing, automating feedback collection, and merging redundant presentation and campaign efforts. Would you like me to illustrate the optimized flow for better clarity?
