To optimize the process shown in your image, I would make the following changes:

### 1. **Simplification of Approval Steps**:
   - **Change**: Merge the "Internal Approval of successful deployment" and "Final Test" into one step called "Final Test and Approval".
   - **Reason**: If the final test is successful, approval can be granted within the same workflow step, eliminating redundancy.

### 2. **Automate User Satisfaction Analysis**:
   - **Change**: Replace "Manual User Satisfaction Analysis" with "Automated User Satisfaction Collection & Analysis".
   - **Reason**: Automating this step can reduce time and effort while ensuring feedback is gathered consistently from users in real-time.

### 3. **Decision Point Efficiency**:
   - **Change**: Revise the decision "Project Presentation to Management needed?" to only happen in cases of major changes or risks (e.g., high-risk projects).
   - **Reason**: Streamlining this decision reduces unnecessary meetings for low-impact projects.

### 4. **Merge PR Strategy and Campaign**:
   - **Change**: Combine the "PR Strategy" and "PR Campaign" into a single task under the PR Team's responsibility.
   - **Reason**: PR strategy planning can happen simultaneously as the campaign is executed, saving time.

### 5. **Risk Management and Evaluation Improvement**:
   - **Change**: Incorporate "Risk Analysis" earlier, possibly right after deployment to production systems, instead of waiting until the project review.
   - **Reason**: Addressing risks earlier ensures the project can mitigate issues before they impact the end-users.

### 6. **Increased Documentation Streamlining**:
   - **Change**: Minimize the use of multiple documents by consolidating the "Deployment Plan," "IT Service Map," and "Records of Processing Activities" into one comprehensive "Go-Live Documentation."
   - **Reason**: Reduces document management overhead, making it easier for the project team to reference and maintain critical data.

### Optimized Workflow Overview:
1. **Start**  
   a. Deployment on Production Systems (with comprehensive Go-Live Documentation)  
   b. **Final Test and Approval**  
2. Decision: Is a Project Presentation to Management needed?  
   a. Yes → **Project Presentation to Management**  
   b. No → **PR Campaign** (PR Strategy embedded)
3. **Automated User Satisfaction Collection & Analysis**  
4. **Go Live**  
5. **Project Review & Effectiveness Evaluation** (including "Risk Analysis" as a continuous task)

By reducing redundancies, improving automation, and streamlining decision points, this process can become more efficient and scalable.
