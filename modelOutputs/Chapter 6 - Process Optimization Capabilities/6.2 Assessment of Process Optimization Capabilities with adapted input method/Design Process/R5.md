To optimize the design process in your flowchart, I would recommend the following changes for efficiency, clarity, and communication flow improvement:

1. **Merge Repetitive Steps**: 
   - The steps “Define Wording and create Translations of mockup elements” and “Adapt Wording and Translations to align them with changed mockup” can be streamlined. By integrating translation adjustments directly into the mockup review phases (before freezing), you reduce back-and-forth steps.
   
   **Change**: Combine both translation-related steps into a single "Translate and adapt wording as mockup evolves."

2. **Parallel Tasks for Speed**:
   - Instead of a strictly linear progression, certain tasks could occur in parallel. For example, while the ICT Project Team works on technical adjustments based on feedback, the Translation Team can begin refining the glossary and list of translations to align with evolving elements.
   
   **Change**: Allow translation work to proceed in parallel during mockup development and QA phases.

3. **Early Feedback Integration**:
   - Introduce feedback from the Translation Team earlier, perhaps right after the mockup review (Human-Computer Interaction phase). This can identify issues with terminology early in the process.
   
   **Change**: Add “Early translation feedback” after the mockup review stage to reduce late-stage translation changes.

4. **Combine QA Report Stages**:
   - The QA reports for both Human-Computer Interaction and User Experience can be combined into one holistic QA review, making the process leaner and minimizing duplication of effort.
   
   **Change**: Merge “Mockup Review: Human-Computer Interaction” and “Design Check: User Experience” into a single step—"Mockup and User Experience Review".

5. **Freeze Mockup Earlier**:
   - By freezing the mockup earlier, following feedback integration and translations, you can avoid constant mockup adjustments. This will streamline the process and prevent over-revision.
   
   **Change**: Freeze mockup after the QA/feedback phase, before final translations, with strict rules for future changes.

6. **Risk Analysis in Parallel with Mockup Freezing**:
   - The risk analysis can be updated while freezing the mockup to save time.
   
   **Change**: Allow risk analysis updates to occur concurrently with the mockup freezing stage, rather than afterward.

### Optimized Workflow:

1. **Start**.
2. **Create technical solution concept**.
   - *Participating*: Project Manager, ICT Project Team.
   - *Documents*: Requirements Specification, Development Guidelines, Design Document.
3. **Develop mockup**.
   - *Participating*: Project Manager, ICT Project Team, UI Designer.
   - *Documents*: Design Document, Mockup.
4. **Mockup and User Experience Review**.
   - *Participating*: Project Manager, UI Designer, QA Coordinator.
   - *Documents*: Mockup, QA Report.
5. **Early Translation Feedback and Adjustments**.
   - *Participating*: Translation Team.
   - *Documents*: Glossary, List of Translations.
6. **Implement feedback and finalize mockup** (Includes translation and feedback incorporation).
   - *Participating*: ICT Project Team, UI Designer, Translation Team.
   - *Documents*: QA Report, Mockup, Glossary.
7. **Freeze Mockup & Update Risk Analysis** (in parallel).
   - *Participating*: Project Manager, ICT Project Team.
   - *Documents*: Mockup, Risk Analysis, Design Document.
8. **Design Review: Concept and technical feasibility**.
   - *Participating*: Project Manager, Coordinator, Review team.
   - *Documents*: IT Service Tree, Risk Analysis, Design Document.
9. **End**.

### Key Changes Summary:
- **Merged steps**: Combined translation and QA-related tasks to avoid redundancies.
- **Parallel tasks**: Performed translation and risk analysis steps in parallel with mockup development to save time.
- **Earlier feedback**: Introduced translation team input earlier in the process to reduce rework later.

This optimization reduces unnecessary iterations and speeds up the design process by promoting parallel work and better communication across teams.
