Here is an optimized version of the process based on your provided diagram, with clear explanations of the changes made for efficiency and clarity:

### Changes Made:
1. **Parallel Tasks for Translation and Mockup Development**:
   - Moved "Define Wording and create Translations of mockup elements" earlier in the process, during the "Develop mockup" phase. This allows the translation team to work in parallel, reducing waiting times for both teams.

2. **Eliminated Redundant Review Step**:
   - The "Mockup Review: Human-Computer Interaction" and "Design Check: User Experience" phases were merged into a single, more comprehensive review step called "Design Review: UX and HCI." This avoids duplication of effort and ensures a holistic review is conducted at once.

3. **Risk Analysis Moved to Earlier Phase**:
   - The "Update Risk Analysis" task is now performed earlier, right after the "Mockup adjustments necessary?" decision step. By updating risk early, potential problems can be addressed before the mockup is frozen, reducing the chances of having to revisit mockup design due to risk factors.

4. **Consolidated Feedback Loop**:
   - The "Implement feedback from quality control into mockup fixes" and "Adopt wording and translations to align them with changed mockup" steps were merged into a single "Implement Feedback and Finalize Mockup." This prevents an unnecessary division of steps and allows faster integration of feedback and translation changes in one go.

5. **Simplified Document Updates**:
   - The final "Design Review: Concept and technical feasibility" now includes an automatic update of relevant documents (IT Service Tree, Risk Analysis, Design Document), instead of requiring separate updates for each document.

6. **Incorporation of Continuous QA**:
   - Quality Assurance (QA) has been integrated into the "Develop mockup" phase as an ongoing task, ensuring that feedback is continuously provided, preventing last-minute large changes after the mockup is nearly completed.

### Optimized Process Flow:

1. **Start**  
2. **Create technical solution concept**  
    - (Documents: Requirements Specification, Development Guidelines, Design Document)  
3. **Develop mockup**  
    - (Incorporate continuous QA feedback)  
    - (Documents: Design Document, Mockup)  
    - *Parallel*: **Define wording and create translations of mockup elements**  
    - (Documents: Mockup, List of Translations, Glossary)  
4. **Design Review: UX and HCI**  
    - (Documents: QA Report, Mockup, Design Document)  
5. **Mockup adjustments necessary?**  
    - *Yes*: Proceed to feedback implementation  
    - *No*: Proceed to finalization  
6. **Implement Feedback and Finalize Mockup**  
    - (Documents: QA Report, Mockup, List of Translations, Glossary)  
7. **Update Risk Analysis**  
    - (Documents: Risk Analysis, Mockup)  
8. **Freeze Mockup**  
    - (Documents: Mockup)  
9. **Design Review: Concept and technical feasibility**  
    - *Final step*: Documents updated automatically  
    - (Documents: IT Service Tree, Risk Analysis, Design Document)

This streamlined process removes redundancies and allows tasks to be completed in parallel, resulting in a faster overall development cycle without sacrificing quality assurance or risk management.
